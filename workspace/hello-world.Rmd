# What is a library?
```{r}
# Cntrl-Alt-I is your friend

library(parallel);          # install.packages("parallel", dependencies=TRUE);
parallel::detectCores();

# Cntrl-Shift-C is also your friend

```
Can you find another library that counts cores?  Is it a core or a thread?

Errors happen, and we need to embrace them.  This is the nature of how we learn from coding.

# Coupling elements together

```{r}
my.seed = 12222015;
n = 9999;

set.seed(my.seed);
x.rnorm = rnorm(n);
x.runif = runif(n);
```
What is `set.seed` doing?  How can you know.  What happens if you set the value to `NULL`?  How long does it have a memory?
It is setting values in the x.rnorm vector and x.runif vector. 
By running it and looking the the assigned values
If you set the value to NULL then it will randomly assign numbers but when using my.seed it is setting specific values
It will have memory as long as it is being used

What is `rnorm` doing?  What about `runif`?  Why doesn't `rt(n)` work?
rnorm generates random value from normal distribution. But runif generates a value from the uniform

rt(n) does not work because it takes more than one argument

```{r}
hist(x.rnorm);
boxplot(x.rnorm);
```
What do each of these show?  Why does Tukey like the boxplot over the histogram?  (e.g., he created the "box-and-whisker" plot, why?)
The boxplot is easier to read than the histogram

```{r}
x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm);
x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif);

plot(x.rnorm, x.rnorm.sample, xlab="x.rnorm", ylab="x.rnorm.sample");
plot(x.rnorm, x.rnorm.sample, xlab="x.rnorm", ylab="x.rnorm.sample", asp=1);
hist(x.runif.sample);
boxplot(x.runif.sample);
plot(x.runif.sample);
```

How is plotting the same data, but changing `asp` influencing our interpretation?  What is the correct approach?  Why?
ASP changes the aspect ratio which allows a better or worse, look at the graphs and is more knowledgable, usually. Changing the aspect ratio can allow you distort or make it more clear. In this example setting the ASP actually reduces the size of the cluster. This is worse in this scenario because it looks more concentrated than the one with no ASP
TODO:  your turn.  hist, boxplot, plot for `x.runif` with the sampling element.  Notice the "parallel" code structure.  Notepad++ and(minutes b Cntrl-H is your friend. (minutes becomes seconds)

# Local Data provenance
```{r}
local.data.path = "/Users/traviscripe/Desktop/github/WSU_STATS419_2021/datasets";  # to store HTML files  # You change this to your "data" path, not your "code/github" path...

path.wiki = paste0(local.data.path,"Wikipedia/");

include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/humanVerseWSU/R/functions-file.R"); 
source_url(include.me);

createDirRecursive(path.wiki);
```

Why would `createDirectoryRecursive` be a better name for this custom function?

```{r}
library(rvest);  # UGH!  Todo, get rid of these "tidyverse" dependencies
library(magrittr); # how do you install these if you don't already have them?


include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/extra/functions-wikipedia.R"); 
source_url(include.me);
```

```{r}
wiki.url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish,_Montana";

wiki.info = wiki.downloadWikiPage(wiki.url, path.wiki);
    str(wiki.info);
```
Look in your "data path"?  What do you see?  Why is this important for a "chain of custody"?

```{r}
latlong = wiki.findCoordinates(wiki.info$path.wiki.page, wiki.info$wiki.html);     latlong;
```
What does this function do?  What is the function name?  What would be a better function name?

```{r}
include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/humanVerseWSU/R/functions-search.R"); 
source_url(include.me);

population = wiki.historicalPopulation(wiki.info$path.wiki.page, wiki.info$wiki.html);
    population;
```
How could I suppress the `NAs introduced by coercion` warning?  Where in the code?

```{r}
climate = wiki.parseAverageClimate(wiki.info$path.wiki.page, wiki.info$wiki.html);
  str(climate);  # doesn't exist ...
```
Review the original WIKI page (WEB -> HTML CACHE).  Is this expected?

TODO:  You do `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish,_Montana` which should have climate.  Also do `YOUR TOWN OF CHOICE HERE` ... for each, the latlong, population, and climate.

# Reading in some data

Copy the file `state-capitals-climatedata.txt` to your local github repo in a folder called `datasets`.  You should now have a few folders at that level:  datasets, functions, latex, and workspace.

```{r}
github.local.my = "C:/_git_/github/TEMPLATE-Pseudo/";

# github.local.my = "C:/_git_/github/USERNAME/TEMPLATE-Pseudo/";

climate = utils::read.csv( paste0(github.local.my, "datasets/state-capitals-climatedata.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");
```

Browse and open the file `state-capitals-climatedata.txt` with Notepad++.  What do you observe?  What are the rows?  Columns?  Why is this a panel of data and not a traditional table or dataframe?

```{r}
include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/misc/functions-midterm-F2000.R"); 
source_url(include.me);

include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/humanVerseWSU/R/functions-dataframe.R");
source_url(include.me);

include.me = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerseWSU/master/humanVerseWSU/R/functions-str.R");
source_url(include.me);


plotTemperatureFromWikipediaData(climate, city.key="capital", city.val="Helena");
```
What does the function `plotTemperatureFromWikipediaData` do?

Describe the graphic.

```{r}
compareTwoCitiesClimates(climate, city.key="capital", city.1="Helena", city.2="Baton Rouge");
```

What does this function do?

Describe the graphic.  What do you notice about the y-axis?  Is this appropriate?  Why or why not?

This is an example of "one graphic" ... each element means something.  It definitely has multivariate data.  The colors all mean something.  Yet it may be "too busy" ... An optimal visualization is the pinnacle of success in data analytics.  One graphic is a search for a "holy grail" to communicate most effectively.

# A few comments

(1) As you begin to "include" things, you will need to start organizing your files and think about the names.  `functions-file.R` and `functions-search.R` are intentional naming conventions given the R, RStudio work environment.
(2) As includes become more complicated and "interdependent", you will naturally wrap them into their own library.  This semester, I will be updating the functions from last semester.  I will drop `tidyverse` whenever I can, cleanup the functions to anchor to `R-base` and move "topics or projects" into "misc" or "extra" like you partially see in some examples.  This will be my work for the semester, called `humanVerse`.
(3) Iteration is necessary with learning and programming.  My next iteration I will review what I have and how to make it more abstract.  I will update based on previous knowledge (e.g., I did not ImageMagick was accessible in R when I create the sun/moon elements).

# Words matter
If any of the code in this notebook is not working, ask yourself why?  Likely, a function is not included, so you need to find the library and include it (and install it if necessary).

Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.";
